# Health-Monitoring-System
This project combines a Pulse Oximeter sensor with an LCD display and a DHT11 sensor to monitor pulse rate, SpO2, temperature, and humidity. It's designed for educational purposes.

# Components
Arduino UNO
MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter Sensor
DHT11 Sensor
I2C LCD Display (16x2)
Wires and Breadboard
# Setup
Circuit Connection: Wire up the components as per the provided circuit diagram.
Install Libraries: Ensure all required libraries are installed in the Arduino IDE.
Upload Code: Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the board.
Monitor Readings: View real-time sensor readings on the serial monitor and LCD display.
# Features
Continuously monitors pulse rate, SpO2, temperature, and humidity.
Updates readings every 5 seconds.
Displays beat detection messages on significant changes.
# Troubleshooting
Check sensor connections and power supply.
Verify library installations in the Arduino IDE.
